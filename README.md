##  What is HireEquity?

HireEquity is a professional, AI-powered web application that helps HR teams, recruiters, and hiring managers write **fairer, more inclusive job descriptions**. It automatically detects biased language, scores the JD out of 100, fixes it using AI, and generates a professional PDF audit report — all in seconds.

---

## Problem Statement

Many companies unknowingly write job descriptions with biased words that discourage qualified candidates from applying and reduce workforce diversity.

| Biased Word | Type | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| "rockstar", "ninja" | Gender Bias | Women feel unwelcome |
| "He should" | Gender Assumption | Excludes non-male candidates |
| "Young and energetic" | Age Bias | Discriminates older candidates |
| "IIT/NIT only" | Elitism | Narrows talent pool unfairly |
| "Physically fit" | Ableism | Excludes differently abled |
| "10+ years experience" | Overly Restrictive | Blocks qualified candidates |

Research by **Gaucher et al. (2011)** proves that masculine-coded words like *rockstar, dominant, competitive* significantly lower appeal for female applicants. Manually reviewing and rephrasing these documents is time-consuming and requires specialized DEI expertise. **HireEquity automates this entire process.**

## What It Does — 4 Step Workflow

```
Step 1 → Paste existing JD  OR  type role name to generate new JD
Step 2 → Dual engine scan (Gaucher wordlist + Llama 3.1 semantic check)
Step 3 → AI auto rewrites biased JD, shows before vs after comparison
Step 4 → View insights dashboard + download PDF audit report
```

##  Dataset Used

**Gaucher et al. (2011)** — Peer reviewed academic research proving that certain words in job ads attract or repel specific demographics. No model training required. Pure word matching combined with LLM semantic understanding.

Wordlist covers:
-  Masculine coded words (aggressive, dominant, rockstar, ninja)
-  Feminine coded words (collaborative, nurturing, warm, compassionate)
-  Age bias words (young, digital native, fresh graduate, below 30)
- Elitism bias (ivy league, tier-1, only IIT, premier institute)
-  Ableism (able-bodied, physically fit, stand for long hours)
-  Overly restrictive (10+ years experience, mandatory PhD)
